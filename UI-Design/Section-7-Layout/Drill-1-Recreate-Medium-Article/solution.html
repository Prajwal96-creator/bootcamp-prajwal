        Design systems are more than just UI kits—they represent a shared
        language that bridges designers and developers.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes a Design System Powerful?</h2>
      <p>
        A well-structured system allows teams to scale efficiently without
        losing consistency. Components, documentation, and tokens together form
        the foundation of a unified product experience.
      </p>

      

      <p>
        Modern tools like Figma, Storybook, and Tokens Studio empower teams to
        build faster. However, maintaining visual and behavioral consistency
        requires discipline and continuous iteration.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        In the future, AI-assisted design systems might automatically suggest
        accessibility improvements, color contrast fixes, or responsive
        adjustments, reducing manual effort and errors.

        “Good design systems are invisible—they let the content shine while
        maintaining harmony.”
