# Drill 3 — Nav + Actions

###  What I Practiced
- Labeling icons to avoid “mystery meat” navigation.
- Combining icon + text for clarity.
- Adding decorative SVGs with `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Creating accessible buttons with keyboard focus outlines.

###  Key Takeaways
- Every icon must have visible or screen-reader text.
- Inline SVGs give more styling control than icon fonts.
- Accessible navigation is crucial for usability (a11y).

###  Example Real-World Usage
Used in topbars of apps like **Figma**, **Gmail**, and **VS Code**—where each icon has a label and clear purpose.
