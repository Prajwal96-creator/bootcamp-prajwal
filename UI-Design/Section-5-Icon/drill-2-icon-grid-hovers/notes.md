# Drill 2 â€” Icon Grid & Hover States

###  What I Learned
- Using `display: grid` for icon layouts ensures consistency.
- Both SVG and font icons can be styled with `color` because of `currentColor`.
- `focus-visible` improves accessibility (shows outline only for keyboard users).

###  Key CSS Features
- `transition` and `transform` for hover animations.
- `box-shadow` for depth.
- `grid-template-columns` for responsive alignment.

###  Accessibility
- Each button uses `aria-label` for screen readers.
- Focus outline improves keyboard navigation.

###  Summary
Font and SVG icons can visually match with shared styles.  
SVGs still provide more control (fill/stroke animation, a11y labels).
