      <p>The 9th India-Thailand Defence Dialogue took place in New Delhi on December 12, 2024. The meeting was co-chaired by Joint Secretary (International Cooperation) Shri Amitabh Prasad and Thailand's Deputy Permanent Secretary for Defence Gen Tharapong Malakam.</p>

      <p>Both sides agreed for early establishment of Joint Working Group to effectively steer and monitor the cooperation in the areas of defence industry. Both sides also agreed to conduct Subject Matter Experts Exchange between Indian and the Thai Armed Forces to carry forward and institutionalise regular engagement in niche domains.</p>

      <p>The Indian co-chair highlighted the potential of domestic defence industry with capacity and capability to cooperate with the Royal Thai Armed Forces in its defence acquisition plans. Thailand appreciated the capability of Indian defence industry ecosystem and proposed exploring possibilities for co-design, co-production and co-development in the field of defence industry.</p>

      <p>The dialogue is a significant milestone in intensifying defence relations with Thailand. Thailand is a maritime neighbour and a valued partner in India's 'Act East' Policy and the Indo-Pacific region. Thailand's 'Act West' Policy compliments India's 'Act East' Policy providing basis for substantive elevation of bilateral relations.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the day, the Deputy Permanent Secretary laid a wreath and paid homage to the fallen heroes at National War Memorial, New Delhi. The Thailand delegation also visited National Museum and paid respects to the Holy relics of Lord Buddha placed at Museum.</p>

      <p>As part of the visit, the Thailand delegation will visit DRDO headquarters and discuss ways to enhance defence industrial capabilities by cooperation in defence research and joint production.</p>
